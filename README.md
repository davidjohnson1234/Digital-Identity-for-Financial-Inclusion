# Digital Identity for Financial Inclusion

This project aims to create a blockchain-based digital identity system to promote financial inclusion for unbanked populations. The system consists of four core smart contracts that work together to establish digital identities, build financial reputations, connect users with appropriate services, and manage privacy.

## Core Components

1. **Identity Creation Contract**
    - Establishes secure digital identities for unbanked populations
    - Uses decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to ensure sovereignty and control
    - Supports flexible verification methods appropriate for different contexts

2. **Reputation Building Contract**
    - Tracks financial behaviors and transactions
    - Builds verifiable credit histories for previously unbanked individuals
    - Creates financial reputation scores that can be used across the ecosystem

3. **Service Access Contract**
    - Connects users with appropriate financial services based on needs and reputation
    - Facilitates secure interactions between users and service providers
    - Provides discovery mechanism for available financial products

4. **Privacy Management Contract**
    - Gives users control over what personal data is shared
    - Implements selective disclosure of identity information
    - Ensures compliance with relevant privacy regulations
